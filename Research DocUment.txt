Draft Research

For the Sprite I will set its origin most likely in the exact middle of the plane to ensure rotation is at its best
For the setposition I will set its position using vectors 5,4 or 150, 124 etc
Settexturerectangle will be used to detect collision between the planes
Set rotation will rotate the plane dependent on mouse click
I will set the texture as 2 planes and an explosion

I will load the images from the image folder
SetRepeated will check for errors if something is false or true and will give out an appropriate error message 

Mouse left and right will control each plane independently 

Event mouse button will draw vectors in which a plane will follow ( Depends on if right or left click ) 

Event mousebuttonpressed will start drawing the vector and mousebutton released will finish drawing the vector drawing a straight line
